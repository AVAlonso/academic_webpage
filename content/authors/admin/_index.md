I am an Astrophysicist studying the behaviour of AGNs in galaxies using state-of-the-art tools with Semi-Analytic Models (SAM). I am part of the BiD4BEST project (https://www.bid4best.org/) studying the science WP3/4 and therefore asking what the physical links between galaxy morphology/environment and AGN triggering are and how state-of-the-art theoretical models compare with state-of-the-art observational data.
